# Unity DOTS Tower Defense Demo

Welcome to my **Unity DOTS Demo Project**! This project is designed to demonstrate the power and simplicity of **Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)** by creating a **simple Tower Defense game**.

## Purpose of the Project

This project showcases:
- How a **tower defense game** can be implemented using **Data-Oriented Design** principles.
- The use of Unity's **Entity Component System (ECS)** to efficiently manage game entities.
- Leveraging the **Burst Compiler** for high-performance code execution.
- Demonstrating **synchronous and parallel jobs** to handle game logic and systems effectively.

## Key Features

- **ECS (Entity Component System)** for scalable and efficient game design.
- **Burst Compiler** to maximize performance by compiling high-speed native code.
- **Job System** to run tasks in parallel, improving overall performance.
  
These technologies combine to deliver a game design process that is both **modular** and **highly optimized** for performance.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Unity Hub**:  
   If you don't already have it, download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub).

2. **Install Unity Version 2022.3.9f1**:  
   Use Unity Hub to install the **Unity 2022.3.9f1** version. Ensure you select the appropriate modules for your platform during installation.

3. **Open the Project**:  
   - Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.  
   - Open Unity Hub and add the project folder.  
   - Open the project in Unity.  
   - *Note*: Occasionally, the project might fail to load correctly on the first attempt. If this happens, close Unity and reopen the project via Unity Hub.
